# Approximate-Tverberg-Point 

This contains the matlab implementation of the lifting algorithm described in the paper "Approximating Tverberg points in Linear Time for Any Fixed Dimension" by W.Mulzer and D. Werner.

see http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0104

The function tvb.m uses vert2lcon.m created by Matt J. http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30892-representing-polyhedral-convex-hulls-by-vertices-or--in-equalities/content/vert2lcon.m

"distinguishable_colors.m" picks colors that are maximally perceptually distinct. The function is written by Timothy E. Holy.
