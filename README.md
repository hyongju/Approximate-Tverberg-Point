# Approximate-Tverberg-Point [![View Approximate Tverberg Point in 2D and 3D on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/50759-approximate-tverberg-point-in-2d-and-3d)

This contains the matlab implementation of the lifting algorithm described in the paper "Approximating Tverberg points in Linear Time for Any Fixed Dimension" by W.Mulzer and D. Werner.

The function tvb.m uses vert2lcon.m created by Matt J. http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30892-representing-polyhedral-convex-hulls-by-vertices-or--in-equalities/content/vert2lcon.m

"distinguishable_colors.m" picks colors that are maximally perceptually distinct. The function is written by Timothy E. Holy.
